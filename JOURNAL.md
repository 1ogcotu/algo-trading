# This will serve as my journal for this project

Entry 10/22/24:
    I made decent progress offline after breaking my computer to better understand the first strategy I'd like to implement. As I'm learning, I'm attempting to ensure that I will be able to replicate this on my personal computer and keep in mind that I want there to be different bots for each strategy. Because the Triad Trading system is the foundation of my trading style it is what I would like to focus on first before using other strategies.
